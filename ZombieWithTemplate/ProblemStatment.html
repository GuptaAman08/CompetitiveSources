<p>Kevin had left his sick daughter alone at house to bring medicines for her from a town far far away. Little did he know that a zombie apocalypse would occur that day.</p>
<p>The government was already prepared for such circumstances and had their new high tech way of commute called as high speed lanes ready.All the towns in the country were connected by roads of same distance. These high speed lanes reduced this distance by half.</p>
<p>The speed at which zombies go from one town to another is same as that of Kevin with his bike but during zombie apocalypse the high speed lanes were activated and only humans knew how to travel from them.</p>
<p>Kevin being a lieutenant was being escorted by a military helicopter named A-47.On hearing the news of zombie outbreak from his fellow reporter friend Kevin wanted A-47 to help other civilians but to do so he himself have to travel roadways.Good thing is He has his bike with him in the helicopter.</p>
<p>Now , Kevin wants to know if he can be with her daughter <strong>before or at time</strong> zombie enter their town without medicine or if is it possible for Kevin to bring medicines and make it in time to be with her daughter too by travelling on his bike roadways.</p>
Depending on the situation , he will order the A-47 to go to help civilians and travel by bike himself or he will order A-47 to stay with him and move towards his house.</p>

<p><strong>Input:</strong><br/>
    
First line contains the test case.
    Each test case consists of <strong>H</strong>(the town where Kevin’s daughter is),<strong>K</strong>(the town in which Kevin is when zombie outbreak happens),<strong>M</strong>(the town where Kevin wants to go to get the medicine),<strong>Z</strong>(the town in which zombie outbreak happens) and <strong>R</strong>(the number of roads)
    Next R lines consists of two integers A and B denoting there is a road between <strong>town A</strong> and <strong>town B</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Output:</strong><br/>
    Output can be of three types. If Kevin is able to reach her daughter in time with the medicine output <strong>“With”</strong>,If Kevin is not able to reach her daughter in time with medicine but can reach in time without the medicine output <strong>“Without”</strong> and output <strong>-1</strong> otherwise denoting he will order A-47 to stay.
</p>
<p>
